    "summary": "A scenic mountain hiking trail captured during daytime with bright sunlight creating a dramatic lens flare effect. The image shows a dirt and gravel path or trail running through mountainous terrain, with a wooden rail fence along the left side of the path. The trail leads toward distant mountains and valleys visible in the background, creating a strong sense of depth and perspective. The sky is bright blue with scattered white clouds, and the sun is positioned in the upper left creating dramatic backlighting and long shadows cast across the path. Green vegetation and grass can be seen along the trail edges and slopes. The composition uses leading lines from both the path and fence to draw the viewer's eye toward the expansive mountain vista in the distance.",
