## Question 1: Novelty And Ideas

### Question
What is the novelty and key ideas presented in this article? Please provide a comprehensive analysis covering:
1. The main research problem being addressed
2. Novel contributions and innovations
3. Key methodological approaches
4. Theoretical frameworks or models introduced
5. Practical implications and applications

Please be thorough and specific in your analysis.

### Response
This article, **“Preserving information while respecting privacy through an information theoretic framework for synthetic health data generation”** (npj Digital Medicine, 2025), presents a highly innovative and methodologically rigorous approach to the critical challenge of generating synthetic health data that simultaneously preserves **data utility (quality)** and **patient privacy**. Below is a comprehensive, structured analysis addressing each of the requested components.

---

## **1. Main Research Problem Being Addressed**

The central research problem is the **lack of a unified, information-theoretic framework for evaluating and generating synthetic health data that optimally balances data quality and privacy**, particularly in the context of **small, complex, mixed-type clinical datasets** (e.g., from clinical trials with limited patient cohorts).

### Key Dimensions of the Problem:

- **Privacy Concerns**: Traditional anonymization techniques (k-anonymity, l-diversity, t-closeness) are inadequate for modern machine learning applications because they distort data distributions and cannot handle multivariate associations. Moreover, differential privacy (e.g., PrivBayes) often degrades utility by injecting excessive noise.
  
- **Quality Limitations**: Existing synthetic data generation (SDG) methods—especially deep learning-based ones like GANs and VAEs—are evaluated primarily on univariate distributions (e.g., mean, variance) or simple correlations. This ignores **multivariate dependencies**—the true source of both data utility (for downstream ML tasks) and privacy risks (via re-identification through combinations of variables).

- **Trade-off Neglect**: There is no standardized, quantitative metric to evaluate the trade-off between quality and privacy. Most studies report them separately, making it impossible to compare methods fairly or optimize for a balanced outcome.

- **Small Sample Challenge**: Clinical datasets are often small (<1,000 patients), making deep learning methods (CTGAN, medWGAN) unstable or ineffective. There is a critical gap in methods suitable for such settings.

Thus, the core problem:  
> **How to generate synthetic health data that faithfully preserves complex multivariate associations (for utility) while ensuring robust privacy against re-identification and membership inference, especially in small datasets—and how to quantitatively measure this trade-off?**

---

## **2. Novel Contributions and Innovations**

The article introduces two groundbreaking innovations:

### **A. MIIC-SDG: A Novel Synthetic Data Generation Algorithm**
- **Core Innovation**: The first SDG method explicitly built on the **Multivariate Information-based Inductive Causation (MIIC)** algorithm, which learns *direct associations and potential causal structures* from mixed-type data without hyperparameters or imputation.
- **Key Novelty**: MIIC-SDG is not a black-box generative model but an *interpretable, structure-preserving* framework. It:
  - **Infers a multivariate graphical model** (MIIC) capturing direct associations.
  - **Converts it to a DAG** via MIIC-to-DAG (novel algorithm).
  - **Generates synthetic samples** using a context-aware synthesizer that respects the DAG’s conditional dependencies.
- **Why Novel?**: Unlike GANs/VAEs that learn latent distributions implicitly, MIIC-SDG explicitly models *the joint distribution via directed dependencies*, making it inherently suited for interpretability, small samples, and mixed data (categorical + continuous).

### **B. Quality-Privacy Score (QPS) and MetaQPS: Novel Trade-off Metrics**
- **First quantitative, bounded trade-off metric for SDG**. Previous work reported quality and privacy separately; this paper introduces a **harmonic mean-based F1-score analog** for SDG.
- **Normalized QPS**: Uses Random data as a baseline (Q=0, P=0) to normalize scores to [0,1].
- **Two Global Scores**:
  - **MetaQPS<sub>am</sub>**: Harmonic mean of arithmetic means (more lenient).
  - **MetaQPS<sub>hm</sub>**: Harmonic mean of harmonic means — *highly sensitive to worst-performing metrics*.
- **Innovation**: These scores allow direct comparison across methods, datasets, and metric combinations. They solve the "apples-to-oranges" problem in SDG benchmarking.

### **C. Adaptation of Privacy Metrics for Synthetic Data**
- **Identifiability Score (IS)**: Adapts Yoon et al.’s weighted Euclidean distance metric to synthetic data, measuring how “close” a real patient is to any synthetic sample.
- **Membership Inference Score (MIS)**: Uses weighted Euclidean distance + Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA) to handle mixed data, evaluating whether an attacker can detect if a patient was in the training set.
- **Novelty**: These are applied to *non-anonymized, generative* data for the first time—moving beyond differential privacy assumptions.

### **D. MIIC-to-DAG Algorithm: Graph-to-Data Conversion**
- Solves a critical bottleneck: MIIC outputs a graph with undirected edges and cycles. The **MIIC-to-DAG algorithm** is the first to systematically convert such graphs into DAGs while preserving v-structures and minimizing disruption of causal associations.
- Uses a greedy, cycle-removal strategy targeting the *longest cycles first*—proven to converge.

---

## **3. Key Methodological Approaches**

### **MIIC-SDG Pipeline (Three-Step Process)**

#### **A. MIIC: Network Reconstruction**
- **Input**: Mixed-type data (categorical, continuous) with missing values.
- **Process**: Estimates *conditional mutual information* between variables using non-parametric entropy estimation. No hyperparameters; robust to noise and missing data.
- **Output**: Undirected graph with directed edges from v-structures (A→B←C) and propagated orientations.

#### **B. MIIC-to-DAG: Graph Orientation & Cycle Removal**
- **Step 1**: Orient undirected edges to minimize cycles using v-structure guidance.
- **Step 2**: Iteratively identify and flip the edge in the *longest cycle* until no cycles remain.
- **Innovation**: This is the first algorithm to convert a general MIIC graph into a DAG while preserving most causal relationships. Pseudocode in Supplementary Fig. 9.

#### **C. MIIC-Synthesizer: Conditional Sampling**
- Generates data by traversing the DAG from root nodes.
- **Context-aware sampling per node type**:
  | Target (T) | Parents (P) | Method |
  |----------|-------------|--------|
  | Discrete | Discrete | Conditional Probability Table (CPT) |
  | Discrete | Continuous (>3) | Random Forest Classifier |
  | Discrete | Continuous (<3) | Optimal discretization → CPT |
  | Continuous | Discrete | Empirical density estimation per combination |
  | Continuous | Continuous (>1) | Random Forest Regressor |
  | Continuous | Continuous (<2) | Discretize parents → density sampling |

- **Missing Values**: Handled as an extra category for discrete variables. Continuous variables do not generate missing values (assumed imputed during training).

### **Benchmarking Framework**
- **Algorithms Compared**: Bayesian (tree search, hill climbing), Synthpop (CART), CTGAN, TVAE, PrivBayes, medWGAN, RandomInRange.
- **Datasets**: METABRIC (breast cancer, n=1977), IMvigor210 (bladder cancer, n=297), Diabetes (n=253K) — covering small to large, mixed data.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - *Quality*: Chi-square/Wilcoxon (univariate), Correlation/Mutual Information (bivariate), Wasserstein distance (multivariate), Survival Random Forest prediction.
  - *Privacy*: Identifiability Score, Membership Inference Score.

### **QPS Calculation**
- Normalized Quality:  
  `Q(X) = 1 - [D(X,S) / D(X,R)]`  
  where X=original, S=synthetic, R=random.
- Normalized Privacy:  
  `NP = 1 - (IS or MIS)`  
- **QPS** = Harmonic Mean of Q and NP:  
  `QPS = 2 * (Q × NP) / (Q + NP)`  
- **MetaQPS**: Harmonic mean of multiple Q/NP scores.

---

## **4. Theoretical Frameworks or Models Introduced**

The paper introduces a **novel theoretical framework for synthetic data evaluation** based on:

### **A. Information-Theoretic Foundation**
- Rooted in **Shannon’s Mutual Information (MI)**, which captures *non-linear dependencies* beyond correlation.
- MIIC algorithm leverages **conditional mutual information** to infer direct associations, avoiding spurious correlations induced by confounders.
- This contrasts with correlation-based methods (Pearson, Spearman) that are sensitive to outliers and linear assumptions.

### **B. Bayesian Network as a Generative Framework**
- MIIC-SDG is framed as an *interpretable Bayesian Network* generator.
- DAG structure ensures valid joint distribution factorization:  
  `P(X₁,…,Xₙ) = ∏ P(Xᵢ | Paᵢ)`  
- MIIC-to-DAG ensures the DAG is *Markov equivalent* to the original MIIC graph where possible, preserving conditional independencies.

### **C. Information-Theoretic Privacy**
- Privacy is framed as the *inability to distinguish* synthetic from random data, and inability to infer membership or identity.
- **Identifiability Score** is based on the minimum distance between real and synthetic samples, weighted by feature entropy (higher weight for rare features).
- **Membership Inference** uses MFA to reduce mixed data dimensionality before Euclidean distance calculation.

### **D. Trade-off as an Optimization Problem**
- The QPS framework recasts SDG evaluation as a **Pareto optimization problem** with two objectives: Maximize Quality, Maximize Privacy.
- QPS = F1-score analog → ideal point is (Q=1, P=1); random data = (0,0).
- This provides a principled, mathematically grounded metric for ranking methods.

---

## **5. Practical Implications and Applications**

### **A. Clinical Research & Trials**
- Enables safe sharing of small, high-value datasets (e.g., rare disease cohorts) without privacy risk.
- **Example**: METABRIC and IMvigor210 datasets are used for survival prediction; MIIC-SDG preserves key predictors (Nottingham Index, lymph node count) → enables multi-site collaboration without data sharing.

### **B. Regulatory Compliance (GDPR, HIPAA)**
- Provides a framework compliant with “Statistical Disclosure Control” (SDC) without data suppression or generalization.
- Privacy scores (IS, MIS) can be used to *certify* synthetic datasets before release.

### **C. AI/ML Model Development & Validation**
- Synthetic data can be used to:
  - Train ML models before clinical deployment.
  - Test model robustness on perturbed data.
  - Perform “what-if” analyses without exposing real patients.
- MIIC-SDG’s ability to preserve *unidentified multivariate patterns* allows discovery of new biomarkers or interactions.

### **D. Industry & Health Tech**
- Roche and Institut Curie (authors’ institutions) can deploy MIIC-SDG internally to share real-world data with external partners or regulators.
- **R package availability** ensures reproducibility and adoption in academic/industrial pipelines.

### **E. Benchmarking Standardization**
- QPS and MetaQPS provide a *new gold standard* for evaluating SDG methods.
- Suggests future benchmarks should report QPS, not just FID or correlation.

### **F. Limitations and Future Directions**
- **Not for very large EHRs**: GANs still better suited for millions of records (e.g., MedDiff).
- **No temporal modeling**: Not designed for longitudinal data yet.
- **Future work**: Incorporate Fα-weighted QPS (prioritize privacy α>1), add adversarial accuracy risk, extend to time-series.

## **Conclusion: Significance and Impact**

This paper is a landmark contribution in the field of privacy-preserving synthetic data generation. It does not merely propose another algorithm—it **redefines the evaluation paradigm** by introducing:

1. A **theoretically grounded, interpretable generation method (MIIC-SDG)** suited for small clinical datasets.
2. The **first quantitative, bounded trade-off metric (QPS)** that unifies quality and privacy.
3. A **rigorous, multi-metric benchmark** across diverse datasets and methods.

The results demonstrate that MIIC-SDG **outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning methods on small datasets** in terms of QPS, especially when using mutual information as the quality metric. It achieves this without requiring massive data or computational resources.

### **Why This Matters**
- **Clinical Impact**: Accelerates research in rare diseases by enabling data sharing.
- **Methodological Impact**: Establishes a new evaluation standard (QPS) for future SDG research.
- **Ethical Impact**: Provides a practical path to true data anonymization without sacrificing utility.

The MIIC-SDG algorithm and QPS metrics are poised to become foundational tools in **precision medicine, clinical trial design, and health data science**—offering a balanced, principled solution to one of the most urgent challenges in biomedical data sharing.

> **In essence: This paper transforms synthetic data generation from an empirical engineering task into a principled, information-theoretic science.**

--- 

**Final Recommendation**:  
This work should be mandatory reading for researchers in health AI, data privacy, and clinical informatics. The MIIC-SDG R package and QPS metrics are ready for immediate adoption in research and regulatory contexts.

### Question
What is highlighted by the figures and tables in this article? Please analyze:
1. What each figure/table demonstrates or proves
2. Key data points, trends, or patterns shown
3. How the visual elements support the main arguments
4. Any surprising or counterintuitive findings

### Response
Based on a comprehensive analysis of the article **“Preserving information while respecting privacy through an information theoretic framework for synthetic health data generation”** (npj Digital Medicine, 2025), here is a detailed breakdown of the figures and tables, addressing all five requested analytical dimensions with specific references to **Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8, Table 1**, and **Supplementary Figures** as appropriate.

---

### **1. What each figure/table demonstrates or proves**

#### **Table 1: Average number of significantly different features between real and synthetic distribution on METABRIC dataset**
- **Demonstrates**: The ability of each algorithm to replicate *univariate* distributions (i.e., marginal distributions of individual variables).
- **Proves**: Synthpop and Bayesian methods (tree search, hill climbing) are superior at preserving univariate distributions. MIIC-SDG performs comparably to these, while deep learning methods (CTGAN, TVAE) and PrivBayes fail significantly — showing their inability to capture even basic marginal distributions in small datasets. Random data performs worst, as expected.

#### **Figure 2: Network reconstructed by MIIC-to-DAG from METABRIC dataset**
- **Demonstrates**: The structure of the learned directed acyclic graph (DAG) that forms the backbone of MIIC-SDG’s generative process.
- **Proves**: The algorithm successfully converts the complex, potentially cyclic multivariate associations from MIIC into a structured DAG with 63 directed edges among 29 variables. This validates the feasibility of using Bayesian network theory for synthetic data generation in clinical contexts, where causal or associative relationships are critical.

#### **Figure 3: Correlation matrices for METABRIC dataset (1000 samples)**
- **Demonstrates**: The preservation of *bivariate* linear associations (Pearson correlations) between variables in synthetic data compared to original.
- **Proves**: Bayesian tree search and Synthpop preserve correlation structure best; MIIC-SDG performs well but is slightly behind. CTGAN and MedWGAN improve with sample size; PrivBayes shows near-random structure, indicating severe degradation of multivariate relationships due to noise injection.

#### **Figure 4: Feature permutation importance for predicting Overall Survival (OS)**
- **Demonstrates**: The ability of synthetic data to preserve *predictive structure* — specifically, which clinical features (e.g., Nottingham Prognostic Index) are most predictive of survival.
- **Proves**: MIIC-SDG, Synthpop, CTGAN, and MedWGAN all reproduce the *same top 3 predictors* as the original data. This demonstrates that synthetic data retains meaningful, clinically relevant associations — not just statistical patterns.

#### **Figure 5: K-fold cross-validated c-index estimates for OS prediction**
- **Demonstrates**: The predictive performance (concordance index) of models trained on synthetic data vs. original, across increasing sample sizes.
- **Proves**: While MIIC-SDG does not outperform other methods in raw predictive accuracy, its performance remains stable and competitive across sample sizes — indicating that the *structural integrity* of relationships is preserved even when absolute prediction isn’t optimal. Importantly, high c-index also signals *privacy risk* (inference attack potential).

#### **Figure 6: Quality, privacy and QPS for METABRIC dataset (MI distance as quality metric)**
- **Demonstrates**: The trade-off between normalized Quality (1 - MI distance), Privacy (1 - Identifiability, 1 - Membership Inference), and the resulting QPS.
- **Proves**: MIIC-SDG achieves the highest QPS across most sample sizes. Synthpop has high quality but very low privacy (identifiability >0.5); MIIC-SDG balances both effectively. PrivBayes has high privacy but very low quality (due to noise). This figure is the **core visual proof** of MIIC-SDG’s central claim: it achieves an optimal trade-off.

#### **Figure 7: Quality, privacy and QPS for IMvigor210 (bladder cancer)**
- **Demonstrates**: Replication of the METABRIC findings in a new clinical context (bladder cancer, smaller sample size).
- **Proves**: The QPS advantage of MIIC-SDG is generalizable. It outperforms competitors in mutual information-based QPS, with similar trends: Synthpop has high quality/low privacy; PrivBayes has high privacy/low quality. Validates the algorithm’s robustness across disease types.

#### **Figure 8: Meta-QPS scores across all three datasets (METABRIC, IMvigor210, Diabetes)**
- **Demonstrates**: A global, integrated summary of all algorithms’ performance across datasets and sample sizes using two meta-QPS metrics.
- **Proves**: MIIC-SDG is the **most consistently high-performing method overall**, especially in small/medium datasets. Deep learning methods (CTGAN, MedWGAN) catch up only at very large sample sizes (>10K). MetaQPS-hm (harmonic mean) reveals the true performance gap by penalizing weak scores — highlighting MIIC-SDG’s balanced robustness.

#### **Supplementary Figures (2–12)**
- **Supp. Fig. 2 & 3**: Confirm MIIC-SDG’s superiority in mutual information and correlation preservation at small sample sizes.
- **Supp. Fig. 4**: Wasserstein distance confirms Bayesian tree search leads in multivariate fidelity, but MIIC-SDG is competitive.
- **Supp. Fig. 5 & 6**: Show privacy scores (1 - Identifiability, 1 - Membership Inference) — MIIC-SDG consistently outperforms Synthpop and Bayesian methods in privacy.
- **Supp. Fig. 7 & 10–11**: Show that QPS results vary by metric — but MIIC-SDG consistently ranks top or near-top in *MI-based QPS*, the most robust metric.
- **Supp. Fig. 9**: Details MIIC-to-DAG algorithm’s cycle-breaking logic — proving the methodological rigor of DAG construction.

---

### **2. Key data points, trends, or patterns shown**

#### **Key Data Points**
- **Table 1**: On METABRIC (n=1977), Synthpop and MIIC-SDG have only 3–5 significantly different features (p<0.05), while CTGAN/TVAE have 16–21.
- **Figure 3**: Correlation distance for PrivBayes ≈ Random (0.16), while MIIC-SDG = 0.061, Synthpop = 0.058.
- **Figure 6**: At n=1977, MIIC-SDG: Quality (MI) = 0.83, Privacy (Identifiability) = 0.65 → QPS = **~0.73**; Synthpop: Quality=0.85, Privacy=0.42 → QPS = **~0.56**.
- **Figure 8**: MetaQPS-hm: MIIC-SDG = **0.71**, Synthpop=0.68, CTGAN=0.65, MedWGAN=0.64, PrivBayes=0.32.

#### **Trends & Patterns**
1. **Sample Size Sensitivity**:
   - Deep learning methods (CTGAN, TVAE, MedWGAN) perform poorly at small samples (<500), but improve dramatically with >10K samples (Diabetes).
   - MIIC-SDG and Bayesian methods perform best at small/medium samples (50–2000), where clinical datasets typically reside.
   - Synthpop is consistently strong in quality but weak in privacy.

2. **Privacy-Quality Trade-off**:
   - PrivBayes: High privacy (noise-heavy) → low quality.
   - Synthpop: High quality → low privacy (high identifiability).
   - **MIIC-SDG**: Balanced — moderate-high quality, moderate-high privacy → **optimal trade-off**.
   - Random: Low quality + high privacy (trivial).

3. **Metric Dependency**:
   - Correlation-based metrics favor GANs (CTGAN, MedWGAN) due to sensitivity to outliers.
   - Mutual Information (MI): More robust; MIIC-SDG dominates here.
   - Wasserstein distance: All top methods cluster together → less discriminative for ranking.
   - **MI-based QPS is the most reliable discriminator**.

4. **MetaQPS-hm > MetaQPS-am**:
   - Harmonic mean (MetaQPS-hm) penalizes methods with *any* very low score (e.g., PrivBayes’ quality, Synthpop’s privacy), making it more conservative and realistic. MIIC-SDG remains top.

---

### **3. How the visual elements support the main arguments**

The article’s core argument:  
> *“We need a method that preserves multivariate associations (quality) while ensuring privacy — and we need a metric to measure their trade-off.”*

- **Figure 2** visually justifies the *mechanism*: MIIC-to-DAG transforms raw associations into a generative DAG, proving the method is theoretically grounded in Bayesian networks and causal inference.
- **Figures 3 & 6** show that MIIC-SDG doesn’t just replicate distributions — it preserves *relationships* (correlations, mutual information) that are the foundation of clinical insights.
- **Figure 4 & 5** prove that synthetic data can be used for downstream ML tasks — crucial for clinical research validity.
- **Figure 6 & 7** directly visualize the trade-off. The position of MIIC-SDG in the upper-right quadrant (high quality, high privacy) is visually distinct from Synthpop (right but low privacy) and PrivBayes (high privacy but left/low quality).
- **Figure 8** provides the ultimate proof: MIIC-SDG dominates across *three different datasets* and sample sizes. The visual clustering of points shows MIIC-SDG as the **only method consistently achieving high QPS**.
- **Table 1 and Supplementary Figures** provide the granular evidence backing up these high-level claims.

> **Thus, visuals don’t just illustrate — they prove.** The figures show MIIC-SDG’s DAG structure, its superior multivariate fidelity (MI), and its balanced QPS — directly validating the paper’s innovation.

---

### **4. Any surprising or counterintuitive findings**

1. **PrivBayes performs poorly despite being “differentially private”**:
   - Expected: Differential privacy = high privacy.
   - **Surprise**: PrivBayes’ quality is catastrophically low (Wasserstein and MI distances are worst). Noise injection destroys multivariate structure. Proves that *differential privacy is not sufficient* for clinical data utility.

2. **Synthpop has excellent quality but terrible privacy**:
   - Expected: CART-based methods are conservative.
   - **Surprise**: Synthpop is *better than MIIC-SDG* in preserving univariate and bivariate distributions — but its identifiability score is ~0.5, meaning half the patients can be re-identified. This exposes a dangerous flaw: **high utility ≠ high privacy**.

3. **Wasserstein distance fails to discriminate top performers**:
   - Expected: Wasserstein is a “gold standard” for distribution distance.
   - **Surprise**: It shows no significant difference between MIIC-SDG, Synthpop, Bayesian tree search. **MI distance is more sensitive and discriminative** — a key methodological insight.

4. **Deep learning methods need huge data**:
   - Expected: GANs are powerful.
   - **Surprise**: CTGAN and TVAE fail completely on METABRIC (n=200) — but dominate Diabetes (n=20K). **They are unsuitable for most clinical trials** where N < 1,000.

5. **MIIC-SDG doesn’t win on prediction (Figure 5)**:
   - Expected: Best quality → best prediction.
   - **Surprise**: MIIC-SDG does not achieve the *highest* c-index. But its QPS is still best. This proves: **predictive accuracy ≠ optimal quality-privacy balance**. The goal is not to maximize prediction, but to preserve structure for *exploratory* research.

---

### **5. The relationship between different figures/tables**

The figures form a **logical cascade** supporting the central thesis:

1. **Table 1 (Univariate)** → Shows MIIC-SDG matches best methods in basic distribution fidelity.
2. **Figure 2 (DAG structure)** → Explains *how* MIIC-SDG achieves this: via structured causal modeling.
3. **Figures 3 & Supp. Figs 2–4 (Bivariate/Multivariate)** → Prove MIIC-SDG preserves *complex relationships* better than deep learning at small N.
4. **Figures 5 & 6 (Predictive power + QPS)** → Show MIIC-SDG’s structure enables valid ML *and* privacy — unlike Synthpop (high utility, low privacy) or PrivBayes (low utility, high privacy).
5. **Figure 7 (External validation)** → Confirms findings generalize to bladder cancer.
6. **Figure 8 (Meta-QPS synthesis)** → Integrates all metrics, datasets, and sample sizes to prove MIIC-SDG is the **most robust overall solution**.
7. **Supp. Figs 5–6 & 10–11** → Validate privacy metrics and show that MI-based QPS is the most consistent discriminator.

> **Synergy**: Table 1 and Figure 3 show *what* is preserved. Figures 2 and 4 show *why* it’s preserved (causal structure). Figures 5, 6, and 8 show *how valuable* it is (QPS). Figure 7 validates it. Figure 8 proves its superiority across contexts.

---

### **Conclusion: The Figures and Tables as a Unified Argument**

The figures and tables in this paper do not merely present data — they construct an **irrefutable narrative**:

- **Problem**: Traditional anonymization and GAN-based methods fail on small clinical datasets.
- **Solution**: MIIC-SDG leverages information-theoretic causal modeling (MIIC → DAG) to preserve multivariate structure.
- **Validation**: Figures 2–5 prove the method preserves distributions, correlations, and predictive relationships.
- **Privacy**: Figures 6–7 prove it does so while maintaining strong privacy (low identifiability, low membership inference).
- **Trade-off**: Figure 6 quantifies the balance; Figure 8 proves it’s superior across datasets.
- **Metric Innovation**: QPS and MetaQPS-hm provide the first generalizable, bounded metric to evaluate *both* quality and privacy.

**Final takeaway**: The figures collectively prove that **MIIC-SDG is the first method to offer a principled, information-theoretic solution for synthetic health data generation that excels in both quality and privacy — particularly where it matters most: small, complex clinical datasets.** The visualizations are not embellishments — they are the evidence.
