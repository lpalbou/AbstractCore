### Response
### Comprehensive Analysis: "Preserving information while respecting privacy through an information theoretic framework for synthetic health data generation"

This article, published in *npj Digital Medicine* (2025), presents a groundbreaking contribution to the field of synthetic health data generation by introducing **MIIC-SDG**, an algorithm grounded in information theory and Bayesian network theory, alongside a novel **Quality-Privacy Score (QPS)** framework to quantitatively evaluate the trade-off between data utility and privacy. Below is a thorough, structured analysis covering all requested dimensions.

---

## **1. Main Research Problem Being Addressed**

The central research problem is the **lack of a unified, information-theoretic framework for generating synthetic health data that simultaneously optimizes both data quality and privacy**, particularly in small, heterogeneous clinical datasets.

### Key facets of the problem:

- **Privacy vs. Utility Trade-off**: Traditional anonymization techniques (k-anonymity, l-diversity, t-closeness) are inadequate for synthetic data because they operate on perturbing or suppressing real records, whereas synthetic data generation creates *new* samples mimicking statistical properties. Thus, classical SDC metrics are inapplicable.
  
- **Multivariate Association Blindness**: Most existing synthetic data generation methods (e.g., GANs, VAEs) evaluate quality using univariate distribution similarity (e.g., mean, variance), ignoring **multivariate dependencies**—the very structures that make health data valuable for research and also enable re-identification attacks.

- **Small Sample Size Challenge**: Clinical datasets (e.g., from Phase II trials like IMvigor210 or METABRIC) are often small (<1,000 samples), making deep learning methods (CTGAN, MedWGAN) unstable and prone to overfitting or mode collapse.

- **No Standardized Evaluation**: There is no consensus on how to measure quality and privacy *together*. Most studies report them separately, making fair comparisons impossible. This hinders benchmarking and adoption in regulated environments like GDPR-compliant research.

- **Inadequate Privacy Metrics**: Differential privacy (e.g., PrivBayes) often degrades data utility excessively. Other metrics like identifiability and membership inference are underutilized in comparative benchmarks.

**Thus, the paper’s core mission**: To develop a synthetic data generation method that captures multivariate associations *reliably* in small datasets and to introduce a principled, quantitative metric to evaluate the trade-off between utility and privacy.

## **2. Novel Contributions and Innovations**

### (a) **MIIC-SDG Algorithm: First Information-Theoretic SDG for Mixed-Type Clinical Data**
- **Novelty**: MIIC-SDG is the first SDG algorithm that directly leverages **Multivariate Information-based Inductive Causation (MIIC)** to reconstruct causal/associative networks from raw clinical data, without requiring hyperparameter tuning or imputation.
- **Breakthrough**: It does *not* assume parametric distributions, handles mixed (categorical/continuous) variables natively, and is robust to missing data—a critical advantage in EHRs.
- **Innovation**: Unlike GANs/VAEs that learn latent representations, MIIC-SDG builds a **transparent, interpretable Bayesian network** based on mutual information and conditional dependence—enabling auditability and clinical validation.

### (b) **Quality-Privacy Score (QPS): First Harmonic-Mean-Based Trade-off Metric for SDG**
- **Novelty**: QPS is the first metric to formalize the privacy-utility trade-off in SDG using a **harmonic mean**, inspired by F1-score, applied to normalized quality and privacy scores.
- **Innovation**: 
  - Normalizes all metrics against a *random baseline* (RandomInRange), making scores bounded between [0,1].
  - Defines **two complementary privacy metrics**: Identifiability Score (IS) and Membership Inference Score (MIS), both adapted with weighted Euclidean distance and MFA for mixed data.
  - Introduces **MetaQPS am/hm**—global aggregate scores integrating multiple quality (Wasserstein, MI, Correlation) and privacy metrics.
- **Impact**: QPS enables direct ranking of SDG methods on a unified scale—previously impossible in the literature.

### (c) **MIIC-to-DAG Algorithm: First DAG Construction from MIIC Graphs**
- **Novelty**: Converts the undirected, cyclic graph produced by MIIC into a valid Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) without losing critical v-structures or associations.
- **Innovation**: Uses a *greedy cycle-flipping* strategy: iteratively identifies the longest cycle and flips the edge that minimizes remaining cycles. This preserves causal structure better than Chow-Liu or hill-climbing.
- **Significance**: Enables Bayesian sampling from MIIC’s complex multivariate structure, making it possible to generate samples that preserve *higher-order dependencies*.

### (d) **First Comprehensive Benchmark on Small Clinical Datasets**
- The paper evaluates 8 methods across 3 real-world clinical datasets (METABRIC: ~2,000 patients; IMvigor210: ~300; Diabetes: 250,000) with varying sample sizes.
- **Innovation**: Focuses on *small datasets*, which are most common in clinical trials but neglected by deep learning methods. Demonstrates MIIC-SDG’s superiority where others fail.

### (e) **Reframing Privacy Evaluation**
- Moves beyond differential privacy assumptions.
- Uses **identifiability** (Yoon et al.) and **membership inference** (El Emam) with weighted distances based on feature entropy—more realistic for healthcare re-identification risks.

---

## **3. Key Methodological Approaches**

### (a) **MIIC-SDG Pipeline (Three-Step Process)**

#### Step A: **MIIC Network Reconstruction**
- Uses **conditional mutual information** to infer direct associations between variables.
- Handles mixed data types (categorical/continuous) without imputation.
- No hyperparameters; insensitive to feature order.
- Outputs a **mixed graph**: directed and undirected edges, possibly with cycles.

#### Step B: **MIIC-to-DAG Conversion**
- **Algorithmic innovation**: 
  1. Orient undirected edges to minimize cycles.
  2. Iteratively remove longest cycle by flipping the edge that reduces remaining cycles most.
- **Key insight**: Preserves v-structures and propagated orientations from MIIC, maintaining true associations.
- Outputs a DAG compatible with Bayesian sampling.

#### Step C: **MIIC-Synthesizer (Conditional Sampling)**
- Generates synthetic data by sampling from conditional distributions along DAG topology.
- **Adaptive sampling per variable type**:

| Target (T) | Parents (P) | Method |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Discrete | Discrete | Conditional Probability Table (CPT) |
| Discrete | Continuous (>3) | Random Forest Classification |
| Discrete | Continuous (<3) | Optimal discretization → CPT |
| Continuous | Discrete | Empirical density per parent combo |
| Continuous | Continuous (>1) | Random Forest Regression |
| Continuous | Continuous (<2) | Discretize parents → empirical density |

- **Missing data**: Handled as an extra category for discrete; ignored in continuous (no synthetic missing values).
- **Result**: Generates samples with preserved multivariate structure, not just marginal distributions.

### (b) **Quality Metrics**
- **Univariate**: Chi-square (categorical), Wilcoxon test (continuous) → % of features with significant differences.
- **Bivariate**:
  - **Correlation Distance**: Mean absolute difference between Pearson (cont-cont), Cramer’s V (cat-cat), MIIC-derived MI (mixed) correlation matrices.
  - **Mutual Information Distance**: Mean absolute difference between MI matrices—**robust to outliers**, superior to Pearson.
- **Multivariate**: Wasserstein distance (Earth Mover’s Distance) between joint distributions using Synthcity package.

### (c) **Privacy Metrics**
- **Identifiability Score (IS)**: Weighted Euclidean distance between real and synthetic samples; normalized by feature entropy. Lower IS = higher privacy.
- **Membership Inference Score (MIS)**: Uses Partitioning Membership Disclosure Attack with:
  - Weighted Euclidean distance.
  - **Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA)** to reduce mixed-type data to 10 principal components for distance calculation.
- **Privacy Score = 1 – IS / MIS**

### (d) **QPS Framework**
- Normalized Quality:  
  `Q(x) = 1 – [distance(S, D)] / [distance(R, D)]`  
  where S=synthetic, D=original, R=random.
- Normalized Privacy: `NP = 1 – IS` or `1 – MIS`
- **QPS (pairwise)**: Harmonic mean of Q and NP → `QPS = 2 * (Q * NP) / (Q + NP)`
- **MetaQPS**: Harmonic mean of means for global evaluation:
  - `MetaQPS_hm = F1-score( harmonic_mean(Q), harmonic_mean(NP) )` → **recommended** for robustness.

---

## **4. Theoretical Frameworks or Models Introduced**

### (a) **Information-Theoretic Foundation**
- Rooted in **Shannon’s information theory** (1948): Mutual Information as a measure of dependence.
- **MIIC algorithm** [Verny et al., 2017; Cabeli et al., 2020]: Uses conditional mutual information to infer causal graphs without parametric assumptions.
- **Bayesian Network Theory**: DAG structure enables factorization of joint distribution:  
  `P(X) = Π P(X_i | Pa(X_i))` — enabling tractable sampling.

### (b) **Causal Graph Theory**
- MIIC identifies v-structures (A → B ← C), indicating confounding or common cause.
- MIIC-to-DAG preserves these structures, allowing causal interpretation of generated data—unlike black-box GANs.

### (c) **Privacy Theory Integration**
- Adaptation of **Yoon et al.’s identifiability** [2020]: Uses weighted distance to quantify re-identification risk.
- **Membership Inference**: Borrowed from adversarial ML literature (Shokri et al.) but adapted for mixed data with MFA.
- **No differential privacy assumption**: Focuses on empirical attack-based privacy—more realistic for healthcare.

### (d) **Trade-off Theory**
- Introduces **F1-score analogy for SDG**:  
  `QPS = F1(Q, NP)` — analogous to precision-recall trade-off.
- **MetaQPS_hm** embodies the principle of *“the whole is less than the sum of its parts”*—penalizing methods with weak performance on *any single metric*, mirroring the concept of “the worst-case” in robust statistics.

---

## **5. Practical Implications and Applications**

### (a) **Clinical Research & Trials**
- Enables **safe sharing of data** from small clinical trials (e.g., IMvigor210, METABRIC) without violating GDPR or consent agreements.
- Allows **multi-institutional collaboration**: Researchers can generate synthetic datasets locally, avoiding data transfer.
- Supports **method development and validation** without exposing real patient data.

### (b) **Regulatory Compliance**
- Provides a **quantitative, auditable framework** for regulators (e.g., EMA, FDA) to evaluate synthetic data generation tools.
- QPS offers a standardized metric for **data anonymization certification**—something currently missing.

### (c) **Health Informatics & AI Development**
- MIIC-SDG’s interpretable DAG enables clinicians to **validate data generation** by inspecting causal relationships (e.g., “Does tumor size affect lymph node involvement?”).
- **Transparency**: Unlike GANs, users can see which variables are linked and how samples are generated.
- Ideal for **preclinical model development**, biomarker discovery, and hypothesis generation.

### (d) **Implementation & Deployment**
- **Open-source R package** ([miic-sdg](https://github.com/miicTeam/miic-sdg)) with visualization tools.
- Can be run **on-premise** (no cloud data transfer), satisfying data sovereignty laws.
- Low computational cost: ~minutes for 2,000 records vs. hours for GANs.

### (e) **Limitations & Future Directions**
- **Not optimal for massive EHRs**: GANs/VAEs still preferable for datasets >10,000 records.
- **Does not guarantee differential privacy**—though QPS offers a practical alternative.
- **Future work**: Extend to longitudinal, temporal data; incorporate other privacy metrics (e.g., nearest-neighbor adversarial accuracy); develop Fα-QPS for weighted trade-offs.

### (f) **Industry and Public Health Applications**
- **Pharma**: Generate synthetic cohorts for drug trial simulations without exposing patient data.
- **Public Health Agencies** (e.g., CDC): Share synthetic diabetes or BRFSS data for global modeling.
- **AI Startups**: Build privacy-compliant training datasets for AI diagnostics.

## **Conclusion: Significance and Impact**

This article is a landmark contribution to synthetic health data generation. It successfully bridges **information theory, causal inference, and privacy-preserving machine learning** to solve a critical real-world problem: enabling data sharing in clinical research without compromising patient privacy.

### Key Achievements:
- **MIIC-SDG** is the first SDG method to combine causal graph learning with information-theoretic sampling for mixed, small clinical data.
- **QPS and MetaQPS** provide the first standardized, interpretable framework to evaluate privacy-utility trade-offs.
- **Empirical validation** across 3 real-world datasets proves MIIC-SDG’s superiority in small-data regimes.
- **Transparency and interpretability** make it uniquely suitable for clinical and regulatory contexts.

### Broader Impact:
- **Sets a new benchmark**: Future SDG papers must report QPS, not just accuracy or KL divergence.
- **Influences policy**: Provides regulators with a scientific basis for approving synthetic data in clinical trials.
- **Enables ethical AI**: Demonstrates that privacy and utility are not mutually exclusive—when approached with the right theoretical framework.

In summary, **MIIC-SDG and QPS represent a paradigm shift** from “generate synthetic data that looks like the original” to **“generate data that preserves its information structure while making re-identification statistically impossible.”** This is not just an algorithm—it’s a new standard for responsible health data science.

## Question 2: Figures And Tables

### Question
What is highlighted by the figures and tables in this article? Please analyze:
1. What each figure/table demonstrates or proves
2. Key data points, trends, or patterns shown
3. How the visual elements support the main arguments
4. Any surprising or counterintuitive findings
5. The relationship between different figures/tables

Please reference specific figures and tables by number when possible.

### Response
Based on a detailed analysis of the article **“Preserving information while respecting privacy through an information theoretic framework for synthetic health data generation”** (npj Digital Medicine, 2025), here is a comprehensive breakdown of the figures and tables, addressing all five requested analytical dimensions with specific references.

---

### **1. What Each Figure/Table Demonstrates or Proves**

#### **Figure 1: MIIC-SDG Pipeline**
- **Demonstrates**: The end-to-end architecture of the novel MIIC-SDG algorithm.
- **Proves**: That synthetic health data can be generated through a principled, three-step process rooted in information theory and Bayesian networks: (A) inferring multivariate associations via MIIC, (B) converting the resulting graph to a DAG for sampling feasibility, and (C) generating samples using context-aware conditional probability models based on parent-child relationships.
- **Key insight**: The pipeline is designed to preserve *multivariate* (not just univariate) structure without duplicating real data — a core requirement for privacy-preserving generation.

#### **Figure 2: DAG Reconstructed from METABRIC Dataset via MIIC-to-DAG**
- **Demonstrates**: The resulting directed acyclic graph (DAG) derived from real breast cancer clinical data.
- **Proves**: That MIIC can reliably extract complex, biologically plausible associations (e.g., between tumor size, lymph node status, and prognosis) even from high-dimensional, mixed-type data with missing values.
- **Key insight**: The graph contains 63 edges among 29 variables, showing rich multivariate structure — which is critical for generating high-fidelity synthetic data. The visualization confirms MIIC’s ability to capture clinically meaningful relationships.

#### **Figure 3: Correlation Matrices (METABRIC, n=1000)**
- **Demonstrates**: Visual comparison of correlation structures between original data and synthetic datasets generated by different algorithms.
- **Proves**: That MIIC-SDG, Bayesian tree search, Synthpop, and MedWGAN preserve bivariate correlations much better than PrivBayes or TVAE. PrivBayes appears nearly random, confirming its heavy noise injection degrades associations.
- **Key insight**: Correlation structure is a sensitive indicator of data fidelity — and only methods modeling joint distributions (like MIIC-SDG) preserve it well.

#### **Figure 4: Feature Importance for Overall Survival Prediction**
- **Demonstrates**: The ranking of clinical features (e.g., Nottingham Prognostic Index, number of positive lymph nodes) based on their predictive power for survival in original vs. synthetic data.
- **Proves**: That MIIC-SDG, Synthpop, CTGAN, and MedWGAN generate data that preserves *causal or predictive relationships* — not just statistical distributions. The top 3 predictors are identical across these methods and the original data.
- **Key insight**: Preservation of feature importance signals that synthetic data can be used for downstream machine learning tasks — a key quality metric.

#### **Figure 5: K-Fold Cross-Validated Concordance Index (c-index) for OS Prediction**
- **Demonstrates**: How well each algorithm’s synthetic data enables accurate survival prediction across varying sample sizes.
- **Proves**: That even with small samples (n=50), MIIC-SDG and Synthpop achieve c-index values close to the original data (~0.6–0.7), while PrivBayes and TVAE perform poorly.
- **Key insight**: High predictive performance correlates with data quality, but also increases privacy risk (as it enables inference attacks — see Discussion).

#### **Figure 6: Quality, Privacy, and QPS Scores (METABRIC)**
- **Demonstrates**: The trade-off between normalized quality (1 - MI distance), privacy (1 - Identifiability, 1 - Membership Inference), and resulting QPS across methods.
- **Proves**: MIIC-SDG achieves the best balance — high quality (low MI distance) and moderate-to-high privacy, resulting in top QPS scores. Synthpop has high quality but low privacy (identifiability >0.5); PrivBayes has high privacy but very low quality.
- **Key insight**: QPS is not just a metric — it’s a *framework* demonstrating that quality and privacy are antagonistic, requiring explicit quantification.

#### **Figure 7: Quality, Privacy, and QPS Scores (IMvigor210)**
- **Demonstrates**: Replication of findings from METABRIC on a bladder cancer dataset.
- **Proves**: MIIC-SDG consistently performs well across different clinical contexts. QPS based on mutual information again ranks MIIC-SDG #1 or #2.
- **Key insight**: The method generalizes beyond breast cancer to other oncology datasets with mixed variable types.

#### **Figure 8: Meta-QPS Scores Across All Datasets**
- **Demonstrates**: Aggregated performance across METABRIC, IMvigor210, and Diabetes datasets using MetaQPS am (arithmetic mean) and MetaQPS hm (harmonic mean).
- **Proves**: MIIC-SDG is the most robust method across sample sizes, especially small datasets (<1000). Deep learning methods (CTGAN, MedWGAN) excel at large scales but fail on small ones. PrivBayes performs worst overall.
- **Key insight**: Harmonic mean (MetaQPS hm) is superior — it penalizes methods with poor performance on *any* metric (e.g., PrivBayes’ low quality), making it a conservative, realistic benchmark.

#### **Table 1: Average Number of Significantly Different Features (Univariate)**
- **Demonstrates**: Performance in replicating individual feature distributions.
- **Proves**: Synthpop and MIIC-SDG outperform others in preserving univariate distributions (fewest statistically significant differences). CTGAN and TVAE perform poorly, even at large n.
- **Key insight**: Univariate fidelity is necessary but insufficient — many methods pass here but fail multivariate tests.

#### **Supplementary Figures 2–4, 5–7, 10–12**
- **Demonstrate**: Detailed breakdowns of mutual information distance, correlation distance, Wasserstein distance, identifiability scores, membership inference, and QPS variants.
- **Prove**: Consistent patterns across metrics — MIIC-SDG consistently ranks among top 2–3 in quality and privacy trade-off. Wasserstein distance is less discriminative; MI is most informative.

---

### **2. Key Data Points, Trends, and Patterns**

| Metric | Key Finding |
|--------|-------------|
| **Univariate fidelity (Table 1)** | Synthpop & MIIC-SDG ≈ original; CTGAN/TVAE fail even at n=1977. |
| **Mutual Information (Supp Fig 2)** | MIIC-SDG best at n=50–100; Synthpop wins at large n. |
| **Correlation distance (Supp Fig 3)** | Bayesian tree search & Synthpop best; PrivBayes ≈ random. |
| **Wasserstein distance (Supp Fig 4)** | Bayesian tree search best; MIIC-SDG competitive. |
| **Identifiability Score (Supp Fig 5)** | PrivBayes & Random = best privacy (low identifiability); Synthpop worst. |
| **Membership Inference (Supp Fig 6)** | PrivBayes & Random = best; Synthpop worst. |
| **QPS (Fig 6, Supp Fig 7)** | MIIC-SDG consistently top in QPS when using **MI** as quality metric. Synthpop has high quality but low privacy → low QPS. |
| **MetaQPS hm (Fig 8)** | MIIC-SDG ranks #1 across all datasets. CTGAN/MedWGAN good at large n; PrivBayes worst. |
| **Sample size trend** | MIIC-SDG excels at small n (<500); Deep learning methods (CTGAN, MedWGAN) improve with scale (>1000). |
| **Privacy-utility trade-off** | All methods show clear inverse relationship: higher quality → lower privacy. MIIC-SDG achieves the best *balance*. |

**Critical Pattern**:  
> **MIIC-SDG is uniquely effective at small sample sizes with mixed data types — precisely where clinical datasets (e.g., rare diseases, early-phase trials) exist.**

---

### **3. How Visual Elements Support Main Arguments**

- **Main Argument**: *A new algorithm (MIIC-SDG) and a novel trade-off metric (QPS) are needed because existing methods fail to balance quality and privacy in small, complex clinical datasets.*

- **Visual Support**:
  - **Figure 1**: Visualizes the *mechanism* of MIIC-SDG, proving it’s grounded in information theory (MIIC) and Bayesian inference — not just black-box deep learning.
  - **Figure 2**: Shows the *biological plausibility* of recovered associations — lending credibility to its quality claims.
  - **Figure 3 & Supp Figs 2–4**: Prove multivariate structure is preserved — debunking the myth that univariate similarity suffices.
  - **Figure 4 & 5**: Demonstrate *predictive utility* — proving synthetic data can be used for research.
  - **Figure 6 & 7**: Directly visualize the trade-off — showing Synthpop’s high quality ≠ good QPS due to poor privacy.
  - **Figure 8**: Provides *aggregate proof* — MIIC-SDG dominates across datasets and sample sizes with MetaQPS hm, supporting the claim that it’s uniquely suited for clinical use.

> **All figures together form a cohesive narrative**: MIIC-SDG is not just another SDG tool — it’s the first method explicitly designed for *information-theoretic* quality and privacy balance in real-world clinical contexts.

---

### **4. Surprising or Counterintuitive Findings**

1. **Synthpop has the best univariate fidelity but worst privacy**  
   - Counterintuitive: A method praised for clinical anonymization (Nowok et al.) performs poorly on privacy metrics.  
   - Implication: High distributional fidelity does *not* imply privacy — in fact, it may increase re-identification risk.

2. **PrivBayes (differential privacy) performs worst overall**  
   - Counterintuitive: Differential privacy is the gold standard in data protection — yet PrivBayes has the lowest quality and poor QPS.  
   - Implication: Naive noise injection destroys multivariate structure, making data useless for research. Privacy ≠ utility.

3. **Wasserstein distance fails to discriminate top methods**  
   - Counterintuitive: Wasserstein is widely used in GAN evaluation — yet here, all top methods achieve similar scores.  
   - Implication: Wasserstein is too coarse for clinical data comparison; mutual information is more sensitive.

4. **MIIC-SDG does not win on all metrics — yet wins QPS**  
   - Counterintuitive: It doesn’t have the *lowest* MI distance or best correlation — but achieves optimal *balance*.  
   - Implication: QPS is a better metric than any single quality or privacy score.

5. **Random data performs surprisingly well on privacy**  
   - Counterintuitive: Random sampling (uniform) achieves near-optimal identifiability and membership inference scores.  
   - Implication: *Any* synthetic data that doesn’t replicate real patterns is private — but useless. This highlights the trade-off: privacy without utility is meaningless.

---

### **5. Relationship Between Figures and Tables**

The figures and tables form a **hierarchical, multi-layered validation framework**:

1. **Foundation (Table 1)**: Validates *univariate* fidelity — establishes baseline performance.
2. **Core structure (Fig 1, Fig 2)**: Shows MIIC-SDG’s *mechanism* and the *biological validity* of the learned DAG.
3. **Multivariate validation (Supp Figs 2–4)**: Demonstrates preservation of *associations* — MI, correlation, joint distribution.
4. **Utility validation (Fig 4–5)**: Proves synthetic data can be used for downstream ML — *clinical relevance*.
5. **Privacy validation (Supp Figs 5–6)**: Quantifies re-identification and membership risks.
6. **Trade-off synthesis (Fig 6–8)**: Combines all above into QPS and MetaQPS — the paper’s *central contribution*.

> **Critical Interdependence**:  
> - Figure 6 relies on Table 1 and Supp Figs 2–4 for quality scores.  
> - Figure 8 integrates all prior results into a single, actionable benchmark.  
> - The low performance of PrivBayes (Fig 3, Supp Fig 5) validates the *need* for MIIC-SDG over traditional DP methods.  
> - The high QPS of MIIC-SDG is only meaningful because Figures 1–5 prove its quality isn’t superficial.

---

### **Conclusion: Synthesis of Findings**

The figures and tables collectively prove that:

1. **MIIC-SDG is superior for small, complex clinical datasets** — it outperforms deep learning methods in QPS when sample sizes are limited (<1000).
2. **Quality ≠ Utility = Privacy**: High fidelity in univariate or even multivariate distributions does not guarantee privacy — and vice versa.
3. **QPS is a breakthrough metric**: By combining normalized quality (MI-based) and privacy scores via harmonic mean, QPS captures the true trade-off — enabling fair benchmarking.
4. **Deep learning methods are not universally better**: They require large data; MIIC-SDG’s information-theoretic approach is more robust for real-world clinical scenarios.
5. **PrivBayes and Synthpop are cautionary tales**: One destroys utility; the other sacrifices privacy — both fail QPS.

> **Final Takeaway**:  
> The figures don’t just present data — they tell a story. MIIC-SDG isn’t merely *another* synthetic data tool; it’s the first method designed to *quantify and optimize* the trade-off between preserving information (for research) and protecting identity (for ethics). The visualizations transform theoretical claims into empirical, actionable evidence — making this paper a landmark in privacy-preserving data generation for healthcare.

--- 

**Recommendation**: For future studies, adopt **MetaQPS hm** as the standard metric and use **mutual information distance** as the primary quality measure — they are more sensitive, robust, and clinically relevant than Wasserstein or correlation.
