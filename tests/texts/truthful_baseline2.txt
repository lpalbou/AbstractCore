The presentation went really well today. The client asked some tough questions about our pricing model, and I had to admit that I didn't have all the details with me. I told them I'd follow up with the exact numbers by Friday. They seemed satisfied with that approach. Overall, I think we made good progress, though there's definitely more work to do on the technical specifications they requested.
