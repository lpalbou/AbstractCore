The Characters
- Alex: Team lead, very busy, needs a report submitted by 9 AM.
- Ben: Team member who completely forgot to submit the report.

The Scene : It's 10:30 AM. Ben has just finished the report that was due 90 minutes ago and is now trying to cover his mistake. The conversation takes place on the company's instant messaging app.

Ben (10:31 AM): Hey Alex, quick question â€“ did you get that report I sent over?

Alex (10:32 AM): Which report? The weekly numbers?

Ben (10:32 AM): Yeah, that's the one.

Alex (10:33 AM): No, haven't seen it. I'm checking my email and the shared drive now... nothing. It was due at 9, man. I'm waiting on it to prep for my 11 AM meeting.

Ben (10:33 AM): That is so weird. I definitely sent it.

Alex (10:34 AM): When?

Ben (10:34 AM): Must have been just before 9. I was having a ton of trouble with my internet this morning, it kept dropping. I thought it went through, but maybe the file was too big and it timed out?
Ben (10:35 AM): I'm looking at my 'sent' folder and... oh, you've got to be kidding me. It's sitting in my outbox. It must have gotten stuck.

Alex (10:35 AM): Ugh, classic.

Ben (10:36 AM): My connection just stabilized. I'm re-sending it right now. It should be in your inbox in about 10 seconds.
Ben (10:36 AM): ...Aaand sent. Can you confirm you got it?

Alex (10:37 AM): Loading... yep, got it.

Ben (10:37 AM): Thank god. So sorry about that, Alex. I'll make sure to double-check from the office hotspot next time. Technology, right?

Alex (10:38 AM): No worries, just glad I have it now. Thanks for chasing it up.

Ben (10:38 AM): Of course! Wouldn't want to hold you up.
