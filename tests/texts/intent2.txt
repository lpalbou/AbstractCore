The Characters
- David: A-player, very on-top-of his client accounts.
- Maria: A colleague who was asked to cover a routine check-in call for David while he was out.

The Scene : David is back in the office. His client, Mr. Henderson, just emailed him, "Disappointed no one reached out as promised yesterday." David goes to Maria's desk.

David: Hey Maria, quick one. I just got an email from Henderson. He said he never got his check-in call yesterday. What happened?

Maria: Oh, hey David! Gosh, yesterday was just manic, you wouldn't believe it. The new product launch files are a total mess.

David: I heard. But what about the Henderson call? Did you not get a chance to connect?

Maria: No, I mean, I definitely tried to get a hold of them. I had that slot blocked off for you.

David: Tried? What do you mean? Did you call and it went to voicemail?

Maria: You know how that office is, they're always impossible to reach. Honestly, David, I don't know how you manage them. You're so good at handling that account.

David: So... you didn't actually speak to anyone?

Maria: Like I said, that part of the afternoon just got completely buried. I must have just gotten pulled into the fire drill with the launch. Did you hear what Mark from engineering said?

David: Okay. So you didn't make the call.

Maria: I didn't say that! I said I tried. It wasn't my fault the whole afternoon exploded. Anyway, it was just a routine check-in, right? No big deal. I can call him right now for you.
