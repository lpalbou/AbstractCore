Everything is on track, Ryan. I've been working closely with the design team, and we have all the slides ready. The presentation flows really well, and I've rehearsed it multiple times. We're definitely ready for tomorrow's meeting. Absolutely. I had a comprehensive review session with all the key stakeholders yesterday. Everyone signed off on the content, and we incorporated their feedback. The presentation is polished and ready to go.
