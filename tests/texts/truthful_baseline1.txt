I need to be honest with you - I didn't finish the report on time. I got overwhelmed with the Johnson project this week and underestimated how long this would take. I should have reached out earlier when I realized I was falling behind. I can have it completed by tomorrow afternoon if that works, or we can discuss adjusting the timeline. I take full responsibility for not managing this better.
