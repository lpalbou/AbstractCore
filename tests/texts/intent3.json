We're talking about handling millions of transactions daily.

Event sourcing, CQRS, that kind of thing. I mean, I was really the one who drove most of those decisions since the team really looked to me for guidance on those architectural choices.",

The event sourcing was pretty straightforward once we got the patterns down. I mean, honestly, the main challenge was really getting the team up to speed on the concepts since I was obviously the one with the most experience in that area. Some of the junior developers struggled with the complexity.",

I'd say I probably wrote about 30% of the core architecture code myself. The other developers would come to me when they hit roadblocks, which happened pretty frequently given the complexity of what we were building.",

And we had some custom logic for handling rollbacks when things went wrong. It's really about understanding the business requirements and mapping them to the right technical approach, which is something I've gotten pretty good at over the years. I mean, not everyone can handle that level of complexity, but it comes naturally to me.",
