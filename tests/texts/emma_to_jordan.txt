Jordan, I'm in such deep trouble. Remember that big client presentation I mentioned? It's tomorrow, and I'm nowhere near ready. I haven't even started the slides properly. I know, I know. I've been telling everyone that, including my manager Ryan today. But honestly, I've been completely overwhelmed with other projects, and I kept putting this off. There was no review. I made that up completely. I was too embarrassed to admit that I haven't done the work. Ryan trusts me so much, and I didn't want to let him down or look incompetent.
