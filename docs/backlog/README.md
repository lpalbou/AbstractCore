# Backlog (migrated)

The AbstractCore package backlog has been migrated to the centralized framework backlog:

- Planned: `docs/backlog/planned/`
- Completed: `docs/backlog/completed/`

Rationale: the centralized backlog provides a single naming convention, a shared task template, and global prioritization across packages.
