## Key Findings Summary

### Streaming Status

| Component | Streaming | Config | Use Case |
|-----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Summarizer** | No | Yes | Batch aggregation |
| **Extractor** | No | Yes | Batch structuring |
| **Judge** | No | Yes | Batch evaluation |
| **CLI** | Yes | Yes | Interactive chat |
| **Server API** | Yes | N/A | HTTP endpoints |

### Why Apps Don't Stream

- **Summarizer**: Needs complete text aggregation across chunks
- **Extractor**: Builds structured JSON-LD output requiring completeness
- **Judge**: Must calculate evaluation scores from complete assessment

Apps are designed as **batch processors**, not real-time systems.

### Configuration System

Three-tier hierarchy (in order of priority):
1. **CLI Arguments** (`--provider`, `--model`)
2. **Config File** (`~/.abstractcore/config/abstractcore.json`)
3. **Hardcoded Fallback** (in code)

### Structured Logging

Independent from streaming:
- Configuration-driven
- Separate console/file levels
- Verbatim prompt/response capture
- Ready for integration into apps (opportunity)

## Investigation Methodology

**Thoroughness Level**: Very Thorough (comprehensive system analysis)

**Approach**:
1. Identified all apps directory files (4 files)
2. Analyzed each app's streaming usage (none use it)
3. Documented parameter handling (consistent pattern)
4. Traced configuration system (3-tier hierarchy)
5. Examined logging integration (independent system)
6. Mapped relationships (CLI, Server, Config)
7. Identified design rationale (batch vs. interactive)
8. Found opportunities (logging integration)
9. Verified no issues (healthy architecture)
10. Created comprehensive documentation (2 files)

**Files Examined**: 21 key files across the codebase

**Total Documentation**: 1,075 lines of detailed analysis
