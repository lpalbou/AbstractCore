# Research Notes (Non-Authoritative)

Files in `docs/research/` are exploratory notes, experiments, and long-form investigations.

They may include:
- speculative designs,
- incomplete prototypes,
- outdated installation commands or model names,
- results that were never productized.

Use the main docs index (`docs/README.md`) for the canonical, up-to-date documentation.

## Guidance

- If you copy code from research notes, validate it against the current APIs.
- Treat benchmark numbers as illustrative unless a reproducible script and environment are provided.
