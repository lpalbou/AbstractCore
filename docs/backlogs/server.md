Plan 1: SOTA Server with OpenAI-Compatible Endpoints

Vision: "AbstractCore Hub" - One API to Rule Them All

A production-grade server that unlocks the full power of AbstractCore, going beyond simple API compatibility to provide intelligent routing, cost optimization, and enterprise features.

Core Implementation (Phase 1)

1. Create abstractcore/server/ module:
- app.py - FastAPI application with OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- models.py - Request/response Pydantic models
- router.py - Intelligent request routing system
- middleware.py - Authentication, rate limiting, monitoring
- websocket.py - Real-time streaming and events via WebSocket

2. OpenAI-Compatible Endpoints:
POST   /v1/chat/completions       # Main generation endpoint
POST   /v1/completions           # Legacy completions
GET    /v1/models                 # List all models from all providers
POST   /v1/embeddings             # Unified embeddings endpoint

3. AbstractCore-Specific Power Endpoints:
# Provider Management
GET    /v1/providers              # List available providers
GET    /v1/providers/{name}/status  # Check provider health
POST   /v1/providers/test         # Test provider configuration

# Tool Management  
GET    /v1/tools                  # List registered tools
POST   /v1/tools/register         # Register new tool
POST   /v1/tools/execute          # Execute tool directly

# Advanced Features
POST   /v1/generate/structured    # Structured output with Pydantic
POST   /v1/generate/multi         # Multi-provider parallel generation
WebSocket /v1/stream              # Real-time streaming with events

# Monitoring & Control
GET    /v1/metrics                # Prometheus metrics
GET    /v1/events/stream          # SSE event stream
GET    /v1/circuit-breakers       # Circuit breaker status

Advanced Features (Phase 2)

4. Intelligent Request Router:
- Semantic Routing: Use embeddings to route requests to best model
- Cost Optimization: Route to cheapest provider that meets requirements
- Load Balancing: Distribute across multiple providers
- Fallback Chains: Automatic failover (OpenAI → Anthropic → Ollama)

5. Request Enhancement:
- Smart Provider Selection based on:
- Request complexity (embeddings similarity)
- Token limits (automatic model selection)
- Cost constraints (budget limits)
- Latency requirements (SLA enforcement)
- Capability matching (tools, vision, etc.)

6. Enterprise Features:
- Multi-tenancy: API key management with quotas
- Usage Tracking: Per-user/team cost tracking
- Request Caching: Redis-based response caching
- Audit Logging: Complete request/response history
- Security: OAuth2, API key validation, rate limiting
