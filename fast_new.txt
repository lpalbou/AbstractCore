  "methodology": "The research was conducted using a targeted search strategy involving 24 search queries focused on Laurent-Philippe Albou’s academic background, affiliations, publications, and impact. Two primary sources were accessed and successfully analyzed: Google Scholar and the AD Scientific Index (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory profile). The search terms included variations on his name, academic roles, institutional affiliations, publication types, and research fields. All sources were accessed via preview mode, with no failed access attempts. Data was extracted directly from the source content, including citation counts, institutional affiliations, publication types, and field-specific rankings. Verification was performed by cross-referencing key metrics such as citation numbers and institutional roles across both sources to ensure consistency and accuracy. Research mode: fast.",
  "limitations": "The research was limited to only two sources, which restricts the depth of biographical and contextual information available. No information was found regarding Albou’s early life, education, or academic training, leaving gaps in his personal and professional development narrative. The absence of direct access to full publications or detailed curriculum vitae limits the ability to assess the thematic focus and methodological rigor of his individual works. Additionally, the sources are primarily institutional and citation-based, which may introduce a bias toward quantifiable impact over qualitative scholarly contributions. Further investigation into primary publications, academic interviews, or institutional archives would be necessary to fully understand his intellectual trajectory and influence."
