- async ? (huge dev I fear)

- handle images
    - with multimodal models

- better media : 
    - parse txt, csv, tsv, py etc
    - parse xlsx, docx, pdf

SHOULD IT BE IN ABSTRACT MEMORY OR ABSTRACT CORE ?
- handle file attachment
    - session : every file ever referenced
    - file currently attached to the context


- timeout vs RetryConfig ?

need a token estimator to share
