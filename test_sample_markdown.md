# Sample Document for Testing

This is a **sample document** with various formatting elements to test the new text formatting functionality.

## Key Features

The new formatting system handles:

- **Bold text** using double asterisks
- *Italic text* using single asterisks  
- Multiple consecutive newlines that get collapsed
- Single newlines that become spaces

### Implementation Details

Here are some implementation details:

1. Headers get converted to numbered format
2. **Bold text** becomes UPPERCASE
3. *Italic text* keeps its original case
4. Newlines are processed according to rules

#### Sub-section

This is a sub-section with more content.

The system processes text\nwith single newlines\nand converts them to spaces.

But multiple newlines


Like these get collapsed to single breaks.

## Conclusion

This demonstrates the **new formatting capabilities** of the *AbstractCore* glyph compression system.

**Important note**: The formatting makes text more readable when compressed to images.
