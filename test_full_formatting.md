This is a **sample document** with various formatting elements.

## Key Features

The new formatting system handles:
- **Bold text** using double asterisks
- *Italic text* using single asterisks  
- Multiple consecutive newlines that get collapsed
- Single newlines that become spaces

### Implementation Details

Here are some implementation details:

1. Headers get converted to numbered format
2. **Bold text** becomes bold font
3. *Italic text* keeps italic font
4. Newlines are processed according to rules

#### Sub-section Details

This is a sub-section with more content.

The system processes text with single newlines and converts them to spaces.

But multiple newlines


Like these get collapsed to single breaks.
