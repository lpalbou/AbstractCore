## [2.3.2] - 2025-10-14

### Fixed

#### Critical Ollama Endpoint Selection Bug
- **Problem**: Ollama provider was generating excessively verbose responses (1000+ characters for simple questions like "What is 2+2?")
- **Root Cause**: Provider incorrectly used `/api/generate` endpoint for all requests, including tool-enabled conversations
- **Solution**: Updated endpoint selection logic to use `/api/chat` by default, following Ollama's API design recommendations
- **Impact**: Reduced response length from 977+ characters to 15 characters for simple queries, eliminated "infinite text" generation issue
- **Technical**: Modified `_generate_internal()` method to use `use_chat_format = tools is not None or messages is not None or True` for proper endpoint routing

#### Session Serialization Parameter Consistency
- **Problem**: Inconsistent parameter naming between `session.add_message()` using `name` and `session.generate()` using `username`
- **Root Cause**: Parameter standardization was incomplete during metadata redesign
- **Solution**: Standardized both methods to use `name` parameter, aligning with `session_schema.json` specification
- **Impact**: Consistent API across session methods, improved developer experience

#### Tool Execution Results in Live Sessions
- **Problem**: Tool execution results were missing from chat history during live CLI sessions but appeared after session reload
- **Root Cause**: Tool results were not being added to session message history during execution
- **Solution**: Modified `_execute_tool_calls()` in CLI to explicitly add `role="tool"` messages with execution metadata
- **Impact**: Tool results now immediately available to assistant during conversation, consistent behavior between live and serialized sessions

#### Common Tools Defensive Programming
- **Problem**: `list_files` and `search_files` tools failed with type errors when `head_limit` parameter was passed as string
- **Root Cause**: LLM-generated tool calls sometimes provided numeric parameters as strings
- **Solution**: Added defensive type conversion with fallback to default values on `ValueError`
- **Impact**: Improved tool reliability and error handling

### Enhanced

#### Comprehensive Session Management System
- **Session Serialization**: Complete session state preservation including provider, model, parameters, system prompt, tool registry, and conversation history
- **Optional Analytics**: Added `generate_summary()`, `generate_assessment()`, and `extract_facts()` methods for session-level insights
- **Versioned Schema**: Implemented `session-archive/v1` format with JSON schema validation in `abstractllm/assets/session_schema.json`
- **CLI Integration**: Added `/save <file> [--summary] [--assessment] [--facts]` and `/load <file>` commands with optional analytics generation
- **Backward Compatibility**: Graceful handling of legacy session formats during load operations

#### Enhanced CLI User Experience
- **Improved Help System**: Comprehensive, aesthetically pleasing help text with detailed command documentation and usage examples
- **Tool Integration**: Added `search_files` tool to CLI with full documentation and status reporting
- **Better Banner**: Informative startup banner with quick commands and available tools overview
- **Parameter Documentation**: Clear documentation of `/save` command options and usage patterns

#### Metadata System Redesign
- **Extensible Metadata**: Moved `name` field into `metadata` dictionary for better extensibility
- **Location Support**: Added `location` property backed by `metadata['location']` for geographical context
- **Property-Based Access**: Clean API with `message.name` and `message.location` properties while maintaining metadata flexibility
- **Backward Compatibility**: Automatic migration of legacy `name` field to `metadata['name']` during deserialization

### Technical

#### Files Modified
- `abstractllm/providers/ollama_provider.py`: Fixed endpoint selection logic to use `/api/chat` by default

- `abstractllm/utils/cli.py`: Improved help system, added tool integration, enhanced save/load commands
- `abstractllm/tools/common_tools.py`: Added defensive programming for parameter type handling
- `abstractllm/assets/session_schema.json`: Created comprehensive JSON schema for session validation
- `docs/session.md`: New documentation explaining session management and serialization benefits

#### Test Results
âœ… Ollama responses now concise (15 chars vs 977+ chars previously)  
âœ… Session serialization preserves complete state including analytics  
âœ… Tool execution results properly integrated into live chat history  
âœ… Parameter consistency across all session methods

## [2.3.1] - 2025-10-13

### Fixed

#### LMStudio Provider Endpoint Correction
- **Problem**: LMStudio was receiving `GET /models` instead of `GET /v1/models`, causing "Unexpected endpoint" errors
- **Root Cause**: `_validate_model()` method incorrectly stripped `/v1` from base_url before calling model discovery
- **Solution**: Removed incorrect base_url manipulation, now correctly uses full OpenAI-compatible endpoint path
- **Impact**: LMStudio provider now works reliably without endpoint errors in logs

#### CLI Tool Execution in Single-Prompt Mode
- **Problem**: Tool calls generated by models were not being executed when using `--prompt` flag
- **Root Cause**: `run_single_prompt()` method was printing raw response content instead of using tool parsing/execution flow
- **Solution**: Changed `run_single_prompt()` to use `generate_response()` for consistent tool handling across interactive and single-prompt modes
- **Impact**: `--prompt` mode now properly detects, parses, and executes tool calls

#### CLI Output Formatting for Command-Line Use
- **Problem**: Single-prompt mode showed banner and assistant prefixes, making output unsuitable for scripting
- **Solution**: Added `single_prompt_mode` flag to suppress:
  - Banner and help text
  - "ðŸ¤– Assistant:" prefix
  - "ðŸ”§ Tool Results:" header and tool call details
- **Impact**: Clean, script-friendly output when using `--prompt` flag

#### Architecture Detection for Qwen3-Next Models
- **Problem**: `qwen/qwen3-next-80b` generated tool calls correctly but they weren't being parsed or executed
- **Root Cause**: Architecture was incorrectly configured with `tool_format: "prompted"` instead of `tool_format: "special_token"`
- **Solution**: Updated `architecture_formats.json` to use correct `special_token` format with `<|tool_call|>` prefix
- **Impact**: Qwen3-Next models now work correctly in both streaming and non-streaming modes

### Enhanced

#### Universal Tool Call Parser Robustness
- **Problem**: Models generate tool calls in unpredictable formats regardless of their detected architecture:
  - Code block wrapping: ` ```json<|tool_call|>...</|tool_call|>``` `
  - Wrong field names: `"command"` or `"function"` instead of `"name"`
  - Architecture mismatch: Models using formats different from their detected type
- **Solution**: Three-part enhancement to tool call parser:

1. **Code Block Stripping** (`_parse_special_token`):
   - Pre-processes responses to remove markdown code fences (` ```json`, ` ```python`, etc.)
   - Enables detection of tool calls wrapped in code blocks

2. **Field Name Normalization** (`_parse_special_token`):
   - Accepts `command`, `function`, `tool`, `action` as alternatives to `name`
   - Accepts `params`, `parameters` as alternatives to `arguments`
   - Ensures robust parsing regardless of LLM-generated field names

3. **Format-Agnostic CLI Parsing** (`cli.py`):
   - Changed from architecture-based parser selection to universal `_parse_any_format()`
   - Tries ALL parsers (special_token, function_call, xml, tool_code, raw_json) for every response
   - Ensures CLI handles any tool call format from any model

- **Impact**: 
  - Fixed tool call detection for models like `cogito:3b` that wrap calls in JSON blocks
  - Fixed parsing for models using non-standard field names
  - Made CLI truly universal and production-ready across all model types

### Technical

#### Files Modified
- `abstractllm/providers/lmstudio_provider.py`: Fixed endpoint path handling
- `abstractllm/utils/cli.py`: Enhanced tool execution and output formatting for single-prompt mode
- `abstractllm/assets/architecture_formats.json`: Corrected qwen3-next tool format
- `abstractllm/assets/model_capabilities.json`: Added clarifying note about tool call format
- `abstractllm/tools/parser.py`: Enhanced parser with code block stripping and field normalization

#### Test Results
âœ… LMStudio endpoints work correctly (no "Unexpected endpoint" errors)  
âœ… Tool calls executed in both interactive and `--prompt` modes  
âœ… Clean, script-friendly output in single-prompt mode  
âœ… `qwen/qwen3-next-80b` tool calls work in streaming and non-streaming  
âœ… `cogito:3b` tool calls in JSON blocks now detected and executed  
âœ… `gemma3n:e4b` with wrong field names now parsed correctly  
âœ… All existing models continue to work without regression

## [2.2.8] - 2025-10-11

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Streaming Tool Call Tag Rewriting**: Fixed broken tag rewriting in streaming mode
  - **Problem**: Custom tool call tags (set via `/tooltag` command) were ignored in streaming mode
  - **Root Cause**: Broken `_apply_tag_rewriting()` method tried to create temporary provider instances instead of using existing tag rewriter infrastructure
  - **Solution**: Completely rewrote tag rewriting integration to use proven `ToolCallTagRewriter.rewrite_streaming_chunk()` method
  - **Result**: Custom tags now work identically in streaming and non-streaming modes
  - **Implementation**:
    - Added `_initialize_tag_rewriter()` method to properly parse tag configurations

  - Provides complete Action â†’ Observation information needed for ReAct workflows
  - Works consistently across all tools (list_files, read_file, write_file, execute_command, custom tools)
  - No hardcoded tool references - fully generic implementation using existing AbstractLLM infrastructure

### Technical
- **Streaming Architecture Improvement**: Simplified streaming tool execution flow
  - Single processing path: collect chunks â†’ execute tools â†’ format complete response â†’ apply tag rewriting
  - Eliminated race conditions between tag rewriting and tool execution
  - Reduced complexity while maintaining backward compatibility
  - All changes made to base provider - no provider-specific modifications needed
